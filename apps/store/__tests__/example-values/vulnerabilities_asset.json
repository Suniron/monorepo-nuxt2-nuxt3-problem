    "remediation": "For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version4.9.258-1.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.",
    "insight": "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel thatmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or informationleaks.\n\nCVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816\n\n'Team bobfuzzer' reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to ause-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered bycrafted filesystem images. A user permitted to mount and accessarbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service(crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2020-27815\n\nA flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a localattacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause adenial of service.\n\nCVE-2020-27825\n\nAdam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftracering buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which couldresult in denial of service or information leak.\n\nCVE-2020-28374\n\nDavid Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementationperformed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. Anattacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Numberassignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to anyLIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.\n\nCVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)\n\nMichael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends cantrigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.\n\nCVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)\n\nOlivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-freeflaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. Amisbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuouslyconnecting / disconnecting a block frontend.\n\nCVE-2020-29660\n\nJann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the ttysubsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount aread-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.\n\nCVE-2020-29661\n\nJann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which canresult in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage ofthis flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2020-36158\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driverwhich could result in denial of service or the execution ofarbitrary code via a long SSID value.\n\nCVE-2021-3178\n\nWu Yi reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server. When onlya subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS clientlisting the exported directory would obtain a file handle to theparent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meantto be exported.\n\nEven after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients toguess valid file handles and access files outside an exportedsubdirectory, unless the 'subtree_check' expor ...\n\n  Description truncated.
